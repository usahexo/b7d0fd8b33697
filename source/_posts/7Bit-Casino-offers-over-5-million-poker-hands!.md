#  How many three-of-a-kind hands are in poker?

To answer this question, we must first define what a three-of-a-kind hand is. A three-of-a-kind hand is any hand in poker that contains three cards of the same rank.

There are six different ways to make a three-of-a-kind hand and these are:

Three cards of the same rank in your hand (e.g. 3 ♣ 3 ♠ 3 ♥)
Two cards of the same rank in your hand and one card not of that rank (e.g. 2 ♣ 5 ♣ 7 ♠)
One card of the same rank in your hand and two cards not of that rank (e.g. A ♣ 4 ♣ 7 ♥)
Three cards not of the same rank in your hand (e.g. 5 ♦ 6 ♥ 7 ♣)
Two cards not of the same rank in your hand and one card of that rank (e.g. Q♦ 8♠ 9♥)
One card not of the same rank in your hand and two cards not of that rank (e.g. J♠ K♥ 2♦)

Now that we have defined what a three-of-a-kind hand is, let's calculate how many hands there are in poker using this definition: 
There are 52 cards in a deck, so there are 52! or 4factorial, different ways to order a deck of 52 cards. This factorial is divided by 6 because there are six different ways to make a three-ofofakind hand, so there are 4factorial/6 or 6 hands containing three-ofa-kinds out of 52! possible hands.

A three-of-a-kind poker hand is made up of three cards of the same rank. In a regular deck of 52 cards, there are 16 different ranks which can make up a three-of-a-kind. When playing with a standard deck, the chances of being dealt a three-of-a-kind are 1 in 117.

There are 4 suits in poker, so there are also 4 different ways to make up a three-of-a-kind with suits. This means that in a full deck of cards, there are 4 * 16 = 64 different three-of-a-kind hands possible.

When playing with more than one deck, the number of possible three-of-a-kinds doubles. So with two decks, there are 128 different three-of-a-kinds and with four decks there are 256 different three of a kind hands!

#  Discover the odds of getting a three-of-a-kind hand in poker with 7Bit Casino!

In poker, a three-of-a-kind (3 of a kind) is a hand consisting of three cards of the same rank and two other random cards. The odds of getting this type of hand depend on the game variant you are playing and the number of players involved. In most variants, including Texas Hold’em and Omaha, 3 of a kind is beaten by a Full House.

In 7Bit Casino’s online casino games, the odds of getting a three-of-a-kind range from 1 in 72 for 2 players to 1 in 592 for 10 players. The following table displays the odds for different numbers of players:

Players Odds 2 1 in 72 3 1 in 36 4 1 in 24 5 1 in 20 6 1 in 17 7 1 in 15 8 1 in 14 9 1 in 13 10 1 in 12

In general, the odds increase as the number of players decreases. This is because there are more opportunities for players to hold specific card combinations.
