#  How Many People at a Black Jack Table Cuba?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on a number of factors, including the number of players at the table, the betting limits and the rules of the game. However, as a general rule, most casinos will allow up to seven players at a blackjack table.

Each player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting 21 points (a blackjack) or by scoring closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Players can also choose to stand (stick with their current total), hit (take another card) or double down (double their bet and take one more card).

The player with the highest total wins, provided they have not gone bust (exceeded 21). If there is a tie, then the banker wins. In Cuba, the dealer is known as the croupier.

#  Black Jack Tables in Cuba: A Fun Way to Spend an Evening

It's not hard to find a black jack table in Cuba. In fact, they are seemingly everywhere. This popular casino game is a great way to spend an evening in Cuba.

Black jack can be played with anywhere from one to eight decks of cards. The game is simple: the player tries to draw cards that total 21, or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The dealer deals two cards face up to each player and two down, one up and one down to himself. The player then has the option of taking another card (hit) or standing pat. If the player goes over 21, he loses. The dealer must hit on totals of 16 or less and stand on totals of 17 or more.

The object of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand by either drawing cards until your total equals 21 or by having the higher total than the dealer, whatever is lower. Winning bets are paid at 1:1 odds, except for a blackjack, which pays 3:2 (two bets plus the original bet). Losing bets lose the amount wagered only.

Once you understand how to play the game, it's time to find a table. Black Jack tables can be found in almost every casino in Cuba and range from low limit tables that start at $2 per hand all the way up to high limit tables where stakes can exceed $100 per hand.

If you're looking for a fun evening out in Cuba and want to try your luck at the casino, look no further than a black jack table. With stakes starting at just a few dollars per hand, it's a great way to enjoy an evening out without breaking the bank!
