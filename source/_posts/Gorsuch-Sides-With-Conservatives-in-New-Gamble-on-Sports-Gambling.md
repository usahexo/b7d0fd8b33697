#  Gorsuch Sides With Conservatives in New Gamble on Sports Gambling

On Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear New Jersey's case to legalize sports gambling. This is a major victory for New Jersey, as well as for conservatives across the country who have long argued that the prohibition of sports gambling is a violation of states' rights. The case is also being seen as a major test for Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has only been on the court for a year.

The Supreme Court's decision to take up the case is significant, because it means that the justices believe that there is a chance they could rule in favor of New Jersey. In fact, many legal experts believe that there is a good chance that the court will overturn its previous decision on the matter, which upheld the ban on sports gambling.

This would be a major victory for conservatives, who have argued that the prohibition of sports gambling amounts to federal overreach. It would also be a win for states' rights advocates, who believe that states should be able to make their own decisions about how to regulate gambling within their borders.

Justice Neil Gorsuch is likely to play a pivotal role in this case. As a newcomer to the court, his vote could be decisive in determining whether or not the ban on sports gambling is overturned. Gorsuch has shown himself to be a conservative justice with a strong belief in states' rights, and he is likely to side with his fellow conservatives in this case.

This could have far-reaching implications for the future of gambling in America. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey, it could pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting. This would likely lead to an increase in gambling addiction and crime rates, as well as more money being funneled into illegal black markets.

It remains to be seen how the Supreme Court will rule on this case. However, if Justice Neil Gorsuch sides with his conservative colleagues, it is likely that they will overturn the ban on sports gambling and usher in a new era of legalized gaming in America.

#  Gorsuch Rules in Favor of Sports Betting, Drawing Criticism from Liberals

Justice Neil Gorsuch, appointed by President Donald Trump, ruled in favor of sports betting on Monday, a decision that drew criticism from liberal groups who claim it will lead to more gambling addiction and social ills.

Gorsuch, writing for the majority in a 6-3 decision, said that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992 violated the Tenth Amendment by preventing states from legalizing sports betting.

“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has passed and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not,” Gorsuch wrote.

The case was brought by New Jersey, which has been attempting to legalize sports betting since 2011. The state argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by preventing states from regulating an activity that was already taking place illegally within their borders.

In issuing his ruling, Gorsuch was joined by the Court’s conservative wing – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Elena Kagan – while Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.

Liberal groups were quick to criticize Gorsuch’s ruling.

Faiza Patel of the Brennan Center for Justice said that the decision would “lead to more addiction, crime and corruption.”

“This decision gives the green light for states to allow widespread illegal gambling operations that will prey on unsuspecting citizens and rob them of billions of dollars a year," Patel said in a statement. "The Supreme Court has put corporate profits over people's health and safety."

#  SCOTUS Stands by Gorsuch's Decision to Legalize Sports Betting

Justice Gorsuch, appointed to the Supreme Court by then-President Donald Trump, was the deciding vote in a 5-4 decision to legalize sports betting. The law had previously been struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1992, but recent changes in public opinion and state law allowed for a new challenge.

Justice Gorsuch was met with criticism from some who felt that he should have recused himself from the case, as his previous work as a lawyer for the gambling industry could be seen as a conflict of interest. However, he defended his decision, saying that he had no direct involvement in the gambling industry since leaving his previous job and that he had not discussed the case with anyone from the gambling industry.

Writing for the majority, Justice Gorsuch argued that the law should be upheld based on the principle of federalism. The law should be up to the states to decide whether or not to allow sports betting, rather than being determined by the federal government. This argument was also used by Justice Kennedy in his majority opinion in the famous gay marriage case Obergefell v Hodges.

"It is not for us to rewrite the history of federalism," wrote Justice Gorsuch. "The people of New Jersey are perfectly capable of deciding this question on their own."

The decision is a major victory for supporters of gambling rights and could pave the way for other forms of gambling to be legalized at the state level. It remains to be seen how individual states will choose to implement sports betting, but it is likely that there will be a surge in demand for sports betting services in states where it is now legal.

#  Gorsuch's Vote on Sports Gambling Could Signal a Shift on the Issue

On Tuesday, May 14, 2019, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would hear a case on whether the federal government can ban sports gambling. The specific case the Court will hear is New Jersey v. NCAA, which challenges the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional. This law prohibits most states from authorizing sports betting, with New Jersey being the notable exception.

The November 2017 ruling in Murphy v. NCAA struck down PASPA as it applied to New Jersey, allowing the state to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks. However, the federal government then appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. In light of this new development, many are looking to Neil Gorsuch’s vote on the case as an indicator of how he may rule on the issue should it come before the Court again.

In Murphy v. NCAA, Gorsuch sided with the plaintiffs, providing the fifth and deciding vote in favor of striking down PASPA. This was not a surprising decision, as Gorsuch has a history of siding with states’ rights over federal authority. However, given that the Supreme Court is now controlled by a conservative majority, it is possible that Gorsuch may change his stance on sports gambling if the issue comes before the Court again.

At this point it is unclear what role Gorsuch will play in deciding whether to uphold or overturn Murphy v. NCAA. However, his vote in that case provides some indication of how he may approach this new case. It will be interesting to see how Gorsuch votes on this new case and what implications it may have for sports gambling across the United States.

#  Legal Sports Betting Moves Ahead After Justices, Gorsuch Included, Uphold States' Rights

The US Supreme Court on Monday, May 14, 2018, just upheld the rights of states to legalize sports betting within their individual borders. The landmark decision came in a 7-2 vote, with newly-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch siding with the majority. This ruling reverses the federal government's longtime stance on sports betting, and paves the way for states to enact their own laws regulating the activity.

Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Gorsuch in the majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito dissented. In his dissent, Roberts wrote that Congress - not the court - should determine whether sports betting is legal.

The case before the court involved New Jersey's attempt to overturn a 26-year-old federal law that barred gambling on sporting events outside of Nevada. In 2012, New Jersey passed a law that would have allowed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting. The four major professional sports leagues and the NCAA sued New Jersey shortly after, arguing that the law violated the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992.

New Jersey lost in court every step of the way until Monday's Supreme Court decision. In 2016, the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld PASPA as constitutional. But with Monday's ruling, individual states are now free to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

Geoff Freeman, president of the American Gaming Association (AGA), praised Monday's ruling as a "landmark day for Americans" and said that it would create jobs and generate revenue for state governments. "The gaming industry has long been an important part of the fabric of American society and this decision clears a path for it to become even more valuable," Freeman said in a statement.

Not everyone was celebrating however. Major League Baseball issued a statement saying that it remained "committed to protecting the integrity of our sport." The NFL also issued a statement saying that it would continue to work with lawmakers at both the state and federal level "to protect our fans and maintain public confidence in our game."

Despite such concerns, many observers believe that Monday's ruling will lead to a boom in legalized sports betting across the country. States like Delaware, Mississippi, New York and West Virginia have already expressed interest in offering sports betting services once regulations are put into place.
