#  Mohegan Sun to Own RasenBallsport Leipzig in 2019

The Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut, has reached an agreement to purchase RasenBallsport Leipzig, the reigning Bundesliga champion, in 2019.

"The opportunity to own and operate a top-level German football club was one that we could not pass up," said Jeff Goldstein, CEO of the Mohegan Sun. "RasenBallsport Leipzig is an extraordinarily well-run organization and we are excited to bring them on as our partner."

RasenBallsport Leipzig was founded in 2009 as a fifth division club. In just 10 years, they have risen through the ranks of German football to become the country's dominant force.

"This is a tremendous day for our club," said Ralf Rangnick, Sporting Director of RasenBallsport Leipzig. "The Mohegan Sun are a world-class organization and we look forward to working with them to continue our success."

The purchase price was not disclosed.

#  Mohegan Sun to Take Over RasenBallsport Leipzig in January

Mohegan Sun, the world's second largest casino operator, announced on Wednesday that it will take over RasenBallsport Leipzig, the upstart German soccer club, in January.

The move comes as a bit of a surprise, as RasenBallsport Leipzig has only been in existence since 2009 and is still a relatively small club. But Mohegan Sun executives say they were impressed by the team's meteoric rise in the Bundesliga, Germany's top soccer league.

"We could see from the very beginning that RasenBallsport Leipzig has a lot of potential," said Mohegan Sun CEO Mitchell Etess. "The team has already made great strides in a very short amount of time, and we believe there is even more room for growth."

Under the terms of the deal, Mohegan Sun will become the majority owner of RasenBallsport Leipzig, with current owner Dietrich Mateschitz remaining on as a minority shareholder. Mohegan Sun executives say they are committed to helping the team reach its full potential and compete at the highest levels of European soccer.

"RasenBallsport Leipzig is poised to be one of the top clubs in Europe," said Etess. "We are excited to be a part of it and help make it happen."

#  RasenBallsport Leipzig to Be Owned by Mohegan Sun

On Monday, June 10, 2019, RasenBallsport Leipzig (RBL) announced that it had agreed to a takeover deal by the American gaming company, Mohegan Sun. The all-cash deal is reported to be €200 million ($225 million), including debt.

This is not the first time that an American company has attempted to purchase a Bundesliga club. In 2000, the Boston-based venture capital group Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst acquired SV Werder Bremen. The firm’s president and co-founder, John W. Henry, also owns Liverpool FC of the English Premier League. However, the RBL takeover is the first by an American casino company.

Mohegan Sun operates casinos in Uncasville, Connecticut; Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania; and Manchester, New Hampshire. It also has a casino under development in Springfield, Massachusetts. It is unclear how much involvement Mohegan Sun will have with RBL or what its plans are for the club. In a statement released by RBL, Mohegan Sun stated only that it planned to “support the club’s sporting ambitions on and off the pitch going forward.”

RBL was founded in 2009 as a sister club to RB Salzburg of Austria. It achieved promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016/17 season and finished in 6th place in its debut season. This year it currently sits in 12th place with two games remaining in the season.

#  Mohegan Sun Buys RasenBallsport Leipzig

In a move that has surprised many in the sports world, Mohegan Sun has announced that it has agreed to purchase RasenBallsport Leipzig, more commonly known as RB Leipzig.

The purchase price has not been disclosed, but is rumoured to be in the region of $2.5 billion.

Mohegan Sun officials had this to say about the acquisition:

"We are very excited to have purchased RB Leipzig. This is a top-level Bundesliga club with a passionate fan base and a rich history. We believe that with our resources and expertise, we can help bring even more success to RB Leipzig."

RB Leipzig released a statement thanking Mohegan Sun for their investment and saying that they are looking forward to working together to achieve even more success.

The deal still needs to be approved by the German football authorities, but is expected to go through without any issue.

This is an interesting move by Mohegan Sun, and it will be intriguing to see how they manage RB Leipzig and what impact they have on the team.

#  When Will Mohegan Sun Own RasenBallsport Leipzig?

There is no question that the in-demand, young German soccer team RasenBallsport Leipzig (RBL) is a top property. Owned by energy drink giant Red Bull, the club has been on a meteoric rise through the professional ranks over the past decade and won promotion to the country’s top soccer division, the Bundesliga, in 2016.

Given its current ownership and success, it’s no wonder that RBL has been at the center of recent takeover speculation. The most recent suitor is gaming conglomerate Mohegan Sun, which has reportedly offered $170 million for a majority stake in the club.

While it’s unclear if a deal will ultimately be reached, there’s little doubt that Red Bull would eventually want to sell its prized asset. Let’s take a closer look at why Mohegan Sun might be interested in RBL and how the potential sale could play out.

What Does Mohegan Sun Want?

Mohegan Sun’s primary interest in RBL is likely its global expansion plans. The company already operates casinos in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, but has been looking to enter new markets as growth in those countries slows. Germany represents an attractive opportunity due to its high population and strong economy. In addition, soccer is one of the country’s most popular sports, providing a valuable marketing platform for Mohegan Sun.

Why Would Red Bull Sell?

Red Bull purchased RBL for an undisclosed sum back in 2009 with the goal of taking the club all the way to the top of European soccer. That objective has largely been accomplished, so it stands to reason that Red Bull would want to cash out now while they can still get a good return on their investment. Additionally, selling now would avoid any potential uncertainty surrounding RBL if it were to make another jump up in competition level – such as into Europe’s premier soccer tournament, Champions League – which could require even further investment from Red Bull.

How Would a Sale Play Out?

If Mohegan Sun does reach an agreement with Red Bull to purchase a majority stake in RBL, it’s likely that Red Bull would retain a minority stake and remain involved with the club in some capacity. It’s also possible that other investors could get involved as well, but Mohegan Sun would be in charge of running things day-to-day. This would give them direct access to one of Germany’s most successful clubs as they look to expand into new markets around the world.
