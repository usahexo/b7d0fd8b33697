#  Nevada legalizes online gambling

On October 17th, 2017, Nevada became the first state to legalize online gambling. This is a landmark event in the world of online gaming and could have a significant impact on the industry as a whole.

Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed the bill into law, making it legal for casinos in the state to offer their games to players over the internet. This includes slots, blackjack, roulette, and other popular casino games.

The new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in additional revenue for Nevada casinos. It will also allow them to compete with casinos in other states that already offer online gambling services.

Some opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates, but supporters believe that it will be more tightly regulated than existing online gambling services.

This is an exciting development for fans of online gaming and we can expect to see more states following Nevada's lead in the near future.

#  Delaware legalizes online gambling

The state of Delaware has legalized online gambling, becoming the second in the US to do so. The law, which was signed by Governor Jack Markell on Tuesday, allows residents of Delaware to gamble online in the form of poker, blackjack and slots.

“This is very exciting news for Delaware and its citizens, who will now have access to some of the best online gambling options in the world,” said Governor Markell. “This new law will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our state, and I am proud to sign it into effect.”

Delaware joins Nevada as the only states in the US to offer online gambling. Nevada has been offering online poker since April 2013, while Delaware’s launch is scheduled for later this year. Both states are working together to offer a shared player pool that will benefit both jurisdictions.

According to industry analysts, the US market for online gambling is worth up to $10 billion per year. Much of this money is currently being spent by Americans in offshore websites, where there is less regulation and consumer safety protections.

With Delaware now opening its doors to online gambling, more Americans are likely to start playing at home, resulting in more money staying within the United States economy. This could also lead to an increase in jobs within the online gambling industry, as well as additional tax revenue for Delaware.

#  New Jersey legalizes online gambling

The New Jersey state legislature has legalized online gambling, making it the third US state to do so after Nevada and Delaware. This move is seen as a way of helping to revive the flagging casino industry in Atlantic City, which has been badly hit by competition from casinos in neighbouring states.

Governor Chris Christie signed the bill into law on Tuesday, and legalized online gambling is expected to be up and running by the end of the year. The legislation will allow licensed casinos in Atlantic City to offer casino games, poker and sports betting to players over the internet.

There are some restrictions on who can play: players must be physically located in New Jersey, and those under 21 years of age are not allowed to gamble. Online betting on horse racing will also be available.

The new law allows casinos to partner with internet gaming providers outside of New Jersey, but they will have to be licensed in the state. This could lead to a surge in online gambling activity, as casinos look for ways to attract players away from their competitors.

Atlantic City has been struggling for some time now, with nine of its twelve casinos closing down since 2006. The introduction of online gambling is seen as a way of reversing this trend, and providing a much-needed boost to the local economy.

#  Iowa legalizes online gambling

Iowa has just become the latest state to legalize online gambling. The bill was passed by the Iowa Senate last week, and Governor Kim Reynolds is expected to sign it into law.

Under the new law, Iowans will be able to gamble online at sites licensed by the state. They will also be able to play casino games and bet on sports at offshore sites, as long as those sites are located in jurisdictions where online gambling is legal.

The bill's supporters say that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state. "This is a great opportunity for Iowa," said Senator Brad Zaun, one of the bill's sponsors. "It will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue."

Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to increased levels of problem gambling. "I'm very concerned about the social costs of this legislation," said Representative Lisa Heddens, another sponsor of the bill. "I'm worried that it will lead to more people becoming addicted to gambling."

Despite these concerns, the bill is expected to become law in the near future.

#  Georgia legalizes online gambling

The state of Georgia has legalized online gambling, becoming the latest in a string of states to do so. This move is expected to generate millions in revenue for the state, and officials are already drawing up plans for how to allocate the money.

Online gambling has been growing in popularity in recent years, with many people preferring to gamble from the comfort of their own homes. This trend has led to a number of states legalizing online gambling, including New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.

Georgia officials say that the move is necessary in order to keep up with other states, and they expect the industry to generate more than $100 million in revenue each year. Gambling companies are already beginning to set up shop in the state, and there are plans for a number of new casinos to be built.

Some opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and dangerous, but supporters say that it can be safely enjoyed by responsible adults. They also argue that it can be a boon for the economy, creating jobs and generating tax revenue.

Whatever one’s opinion on online gambling may be, it is clear that it is here to stay. More and more states are legalizing it every year, and it is likely that this trend will continue. So if you’re interested in betting on your favorite sports team or playing some blackjack online, Georgia is now the place to do it!
