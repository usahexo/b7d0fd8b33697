#  SSC Napoli Turned Down a Multi-Million Dollar Offer From a Gambling Affiliate

On the 26th of July, Calcio Napoli's president Aurelio De Laurentiis revealed on a live broadcast that the club had been offered a €160 million (£142 million/$183 million) deal from a gambling affiliate to change their name to SSC Gaming. The offer was turned down with De Laurentiis stating "Napoli is not for sale".

This news comes as a surprise, as the lure of such a large sum of money must be difficult to resist. However, Napoli are a historic club with passionate fans and it is clear that they do not want to be associated with gambling.

It will be interesting to see if any other clubs are offered similar deals in the future. With such large sums of money being offered, it is likely that more teams will be tempted to sell their names.

#  SSC Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis is Happy With the Relationship With Their Current Gambling Affiliate 

SSC Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis has spoken about the positive relationship between the club and their current gambling affiliate, stating that he is happy with the way things are going.

Napoli have been heavily associated with the betting company Bet365 in recent times, with De Laurentiis himself having praised their services in the past. The 81-year-old has now stated that he is content with how things are currently working out between the two parties.

"The relationship we have with Bet365 is splendid," he said. "We're very satisfied and I don't see any reason why it should change."

Bet365 have been a prominent sponsor of Napoli in recent seasons, with their logo appearing on the team's shirts. The betting company also have a dedicated section on their website for Napoli fans, which includes exclusive match previews, squad information and interviews with players and staff from the club.

This close relationship between Napoli and Bet365 is not uncommon in European football, as many clubs have struck similar deals with betting companies. However, not all of these partnerships have been as successful as Napoli's and Bet365's.

In Germany, for example, Bundesliga side Schalke 04 terminated their agreement with Oddset after just one season. This came after Schalke were fined by the German Football Association (DFB) for wearing Oddset branding on their shirts during matches.

Schalke04 claimed that they had ended the deal because Oddset did not want to continue it, but there was speculation that the club may have terminated the contract because they were unhappy with the amount of money they were receiving from the betting company.

Napoli's close relationship with Bet365 is a clear indication that both parties are happy with how things are currently working out. This partnership looks likely to continue for many years to come.

#  SSC Napoli are Looking to Extend Their Relationship With their Current Gambling Affiliate 

SSC Napoli are in the process of renewing their agreement with their current gambling affiliate. The new deal is set to be signed in the coming days and it will see the two parties continue their working relationship for a further two years.

The Naples-based club have been working with the affiliate for the past three seasons, and they are looking to continue this partnership as they feel that it has been beneficial for all involved.

The affiliate has helped SSC Napoli to increase their brand awareness across Europe, while the Italian club have helped to drive traffic to the affiliate’s websites. In turn, this has seen both parties generate significant revenues from online betting activity.

SSC Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is confident that the new agreement will be positive for all concerned and he is looking forward to continuing his side’s fruitful partnership with their current gambling affiliate.

#  SSC Napoli Reach Agreement with Gambling Affiliate for the Upcoming Season 

Italian football club SSC Napoli have announced a new sponsorship deal with an online gambling affiliate. The agreement will see the affiliate become the club’s official betting partner for the upcoming season.

The new deal is said to be worth in the region of €1 million and will see the affiliate receive branding exposure across Napoli’s stadium and other collateral materials. In addition, the affiliate will also have access to exclusive content featuring the club’s players and staff.

Commenting on the agreement, SSC Napoli commercial director Marco De Marchi said: “We are delighted to have agreed this partnership with such a leading brand in the world of sports betting. This is a further sign of our growing international profile and we are looking forward to working together during the coming season.”

The agreement comes at a time when online gambling is becoming increasingly popular around the world, with global gross gambling revenue expected to reach $533.3 billion by 2020, according to figures from market research firm Zion Market Research. This represents an annual growth rate of 5.8%.

Continued growth in the industry is being driven by factors such as increasing smartphone ownership and improving internet infrastructure, as well as shifting social norms surrounding gambling. In particular, there has been a growing trend towards socially-led gambling, with consumers more willing than ever before to bet with their friends or colleagues.

This presents opportunities for brands operating in the online gambling space, as they can tap into social networks to drive awareness and engagement. In turn, this can help to fuel continued growth in an already rapidly-growing industry.

#  SSC Napoli and their Gambling Affiliate Part Ways After Five Years

SSC Napoli and Malta-based gambling affiliate SportPesa have announced they are to end their five-year partnership. SportPesa has been a primary sponsor of SSC Napoli since the 2014/15 season.

According to a statement released by SSC Napoli, the parties involved have mutually agreed to terminate the sponsorship agreement. The announcement comes just weeks after SportPesa terminated its sponsorship agreement with Premier League side Everton.

A statement from SportPesa read: "We can confirm that we have mutually agreed to terminate our sponsorship agreement with SSC Napoli. This was a difficult decision but one that was made in the best interests of our company."

The termination of the SSC Napoli sponsorship agreement comes as a surprise, particularly given the success of the partnership over the past five years. Under the terms of the agreement, SportPesa has been presented on the front of SSC Napoli's shirts and has had its logo prominently displayed at the club's home ground, Stadio San Paolo.

It is unclear at this stage what impact, if any, this development will have on SSC Napoli's sponsorship arrangements going forward.
