#  Delaware court rules that single-activity sports betting is legal 

The Delaware Supreme Court has ruled that state’s law allowing single-game sports betting is legal. The court said that the law, which was passed in June, does not violate a federal ban on sports betting.

The law allows bets to be placed on individual games, including professional and collegiate sporting events, but does not allow bets on school teams. It also prohibits gambling on any event that takes place in Delaware or involves a Delaware team.

Delaware is the first state to allow single-game sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May. Nevada and New Jersey are also planning to offer single-game sports betting.

#  Delaware becomes first state to offer single-sports betting 

Delaware became the first state to offer full-scale sports betting on Tuesday, taking advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for states to legalize it.

The state's three casinos - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway and Dover Downs - will offer single-sport betting on NFL, college football, NBA, Major League Baseball, NHL, soccer, golf and auto racing.

"We are excited to offer our customers this new opportunity to bet on their favorite sports teams," Delaware Governor John Carney said in a statement.

The high court in May struck down a 1992 federal law that had prohibited gambling on sports in most states. The decision opened the door for states to legalize sports betting if they choose to do so.

Since then, lawmakers in several other states have introduced bills that would authorize sports betting, including New Jersey, which has been at the forefront of the legal battle over sports betting.

Governor Phil Murphy has said he planned to sign legislation authorizing sports betting in New Jersey as soon as Monday, and casinos and racetracks there say they are ready to begin offering it.

#  Delaware sees surge in revenue from single-sport betting 

In the first two months of Delaware’s single-sport betting, the state has seen a surge in revenue. The state’s three casinos brought in nearly $2 million from sports bets in February. This is a stark contrast to the $371,000 that was generated from sports betting in all of 2018.

The casinos attribute this increase to the addition of single-sport betting to their offerings. Single-sport betting allows bettors to place bets on a specific sport, as opposed to betting on all sports outcomes. This makes it easier for people to specialize in one sport and gives them a better chance of making winning bets.

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban in May 2018. Since then, several other states have followed suit, but Delaware has been able to capitalize on its early legalization by offering more types of sports bets than most other states.

The increased revenue is welcome news for Delaware, which is facing budget pressures due to declining revenue from its casino games and lotteries. Sports betting is seen as a potential source of new revenue for states, as it is estimated that Americans bet over $150 billion on sports each year.

#  Delaware residents flock to single-sport betting outlets 

In the small state of Delaware, there is a big interest in betting on single sports. Nowhere is this more evident than at the state’s three tribal casinos, which draw most of their business from people who want to place a wager on, say, Sunday’s NFL games.

According to Tribal Casinos & Sports Betting in Delaware, a report released in March by the University of Delaware’s Center for Applied Gaming and Simulation, 54% of casino patrons surveyed said they visit the casinos mostly for single-sport betting.

That’s not all that surprising when you consider that Delaware was one of the first states to legalize sports betting after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal prohibition in May 2018. In addition, the state offers some of the best odds on NFL games thanks to its limited number of betting options (teams only, no point spreads or over/unders).

Patrons can bet on NFL games at all three tribal casinos – Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, Harrington Raceway & Casino, and Shawnee Slots – but they tend to congregate at Dover Downs. There, sports betting takes up about half of the casino floor, according to Joe Weinert, senior vice president of research for gaming and hospitality firm Spectrum Group International.

Many NFL fans like to go to casinos on game days to watch the action on big screens while they place their bets, Weinert said. “It just heightens the experience. It becomes like a party atmosphere.”

But it’s not just NFL games that draw crowds; people also bet on college football and basketball, as well as major league baseball and hockey. The University of Delaware study found that nearly 60% of casino customers surveyed had placed a wager on an MLB game in the past month, for example.

#  How Delaware's single-sport betting industry is changing the landscape

As the first state to legalize single-sport betting, Delaware is paving the way for other states to follow suit. While other states are still in the process of legalizing such betting, Delaware has already reaped the benefits, with industry revenue reaching over $1 million in just a few months.

What's more, Delaware's success is giving other states the incentive they need to legalize single-sport betting. This could be a major boon to the gambling industry, as it could help to bring in much-needed revenue.

Just how successful has Delaware been with single-sport betting? Let's take a look.

Since legalizing single-sport betting in June of 2018, Delaware has seen a surge in revenue. In October alone, industry revenue reached over $1 million, with this number likely to grow as new sports are added to the list of permissible bets.

This is good news for Delaware, as the state is currently facing a budget shortfall. Single-sport betting could be just what Delaware needs to shore up its finances.

What's more, this success could pave the way for other states to legalize single-sport betting. So far, six states have introduced legislation that would legalize such betting, and more are likely to follow suit in the coming years.

This could be a major win for the gambling industry, as it would help to bring in much-needed revenue. In fact, some analysts believe that legalized single-sport betting could generate as much as $6 billion in annual revenue.

So why is Delaware leading the charge on legalized single-sport betting? One reason may be that the state has a lot of experience with gambling; after all, it was one of the first states to legalize casino gambling back in 1978.

In addition, Delaware has a well-developed infrastructure for handling sports bets. This infrastructure includes both land-based and online casinos, which give residents plenty of options when it comes to placing bets.

Delaware's success with single-sport betting is sure to have a ripple effect throughout the US gambling industry. Other states will undoubtedly look to emulate Delaware's success and legalize single-sport betting themselves. This could be great news for players and casinos alike, as it would help to boost t
