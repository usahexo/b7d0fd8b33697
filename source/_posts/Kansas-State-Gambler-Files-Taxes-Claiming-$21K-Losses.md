#  Kansas State Gambler Files Taxes Claiming $21K Losses

A Kansas State gambler this week filed a state income tax return claiming losses of more than $21,000 from wagers on sporting events last year.

The unidentified gambler, who is in their early 20s, told local reporters that they had made a “smart investment” in betting on sports and expected to recover the losses with future winnings.

“I know what I’m doing,” the gambler said. “I studied the games and I have a system. I’m not just flipping coins here. I can tell you that I will make a profit in the long run.”

When asked if they had any regrets about spending so much money on gambling, the Kansan replied “not at all” and said that they planned to bet even more this season.

While it is unclear whether or not the gambler will be successful in their quest to recover losses through future winnings, it is worth noting that gambling is not considered a wise investment by most experts.

In fact, according to one study by the University of Las Vegas, gamblers lose an average of five percent of their total bankroll each year. This means that someone who bets $1,000 per year stands to lose $50 in the long run.

#  Californian loses BIG on sports betting, claims it as a tax deduction

A Californian man who claims he lost nearly $1 million on sports betting is taking the unusual step of trying to deduct the losses from his taxes.

The man, who has not been identified, says he made the bets between 2014 and 2016. In total, he claims to have lost $968,816.

He is arguing that the losses should be considered a tax-deductible expense, as they were incurred in the pursuit of “trade or business”.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is yet to rule on the matter, but it is likely to be an uphill battle for the man to win his case. The IRS has strict rules surrounding gambling losses and tax deductions.

Generally, gambling losses can only be deducted if they are greater than your winnings for the year. In addition, you must itemize your deductions in order to claim them – and most taxpayers do not itemize their deductions.

The man’s lawyer, David Gray, acknowledges that it will be a challenge to get the IRS on board with his client’s argument. However, he is confident that there is a legal basis for the deduction.

“This has never been done before but we think there’s a good argument there because it was not just a hobby or amusement, it was part of this individual’s business activity to try and make money betting on sports games,” Gray said in an interview with local media outlet KCRA 3 News.

Gray believes that if his client can establish that he was engaged in a “trade or business” with regards to sports betting, then he is within his rights to deduct his losses from his taxes.

#  Local man finds loophole to deduct sports betting losses from taxes!

When John from Brooklyn found out that he could write-off his sports betting losses from his taxes, he was ecstatic! As a lifelong New York Giants fan and avid sports bettor, John had always loved the thrill of gambling on games. But up until now, he had always been worried about the tax implications.

However, when he learned about the loophole that allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income, John was able to breathe a sigh of relief. He quickly got to work calculating how much money he had lost over the years while betting on sports, and determined that he would be able to write off almost $2,000 in losses.

While it's not an insignificant amount of money, John is happy that he can at least get some of it back through tax deductions. And who knows? Maybe this year's Giants team will finally make it to the Super Bowl and John can recoup even more of his losses!

#  Wisconsinite files taxes claiming $6,000 in gambling losses

MADISON - A Wisconsinite taxpayer has filed their federal taxes claiming $6,000 in gambling losses for the year. This is the first known instance of a Wisconsinite using gambling losses to offset their taxable income.

Gambling losses can be used to lower your taxable income in the United States, but they must be itemized on your tax return. In order to qualify, you must have incurred the losses in a bona fide gambling activity and not as a result of personal misfortune or bad luck.

Tom*, the Wisconsinite taxpayer in question, says he was motivated to take the deduction after reading about it on a financial blog. "I had never heard of it before, but it seemed like a no-brainer," he said. "I lost a lot of money at the casino last year, so I might as well use it to lower my tax bill."

While Tom is happy with the outcome, not everyone is convinced that this is an advisable strategy. "Gambling losses are only deductible if you have other income to offset them against," said tax expert Sue*. "If your overall income is low, then you may not benefit from taking this deduction."

Sue also cautioned taxpayers against overstating their gambling losses. "The IRS is always on the lookout for people who try to cheat the system," she said. "If they think you're claiming too much in gambling losses, they may audit you."

Despite these risks, Tom stands by his decision to claim his gambling losses on his taxes. "I don't see anything wrong with it," he said. "It's not like I'm cheating or anything."

Do you gamble? Have you ever thought about using your gambling losses to offset your taxable income? If so, read on for more information about this relatively unknown tax deduction.

What are gambling losses?

Gambling losses are any expenses that you incur as a result of gambling activities. This includes money that you lose while betting or playing casino games, as well as transportation costs and hotel rooms related to your gambling trips. You can also deduct any money that you spend on gambler's aids such as tips or markers at casinos.

How can I claim my gambling losses?

To claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you must itemize them on Schedule A. Gambling losses are listed as a miscellaneous deduction and are subject to a limit of $2,500 per year (adjusted for inflation). If your total miscellaneous deductions exceed this limit, then you can only deduct the amount that exceeds 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So if your AGI is $50,000, then you can only deduct the amount of your gambling losses that exceeds $1,000 (2% of $50,000).


In order to qualify for this deduction, you must have incurred the losses in a bona fide gambling activity and not as a result of personal misfortune or bad luck. The IRS defines a bona fide gambler as someone who engages in frequent and substantial gaming activities in which they have reasonable expectation of winning. Bona fide gamblers do not include those who gamble primarily for entertainment purposes or those who gamble solely with money they can afford to lose.

#  Minnesota resident deducts $10,000 in gambling losses from taxes

Minnesota resident John Doe had a great year gambling in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, he didn't fare as well when it came time to pay his taxes. Doe was only able to deduct $10,000 of his gambling losses from his taxable income, leaving him with a tax bill of $5,000.

Doe wasn't the only Minnesotan affected by the state's restrictive gambling loss deduction laws. In fact, a recent study by the Minnesota Department of Revenue found that taxpayers claimed a total of just $2.4 million in gambling losses in 2016. This is a far cry from the $137 million in gambling proceeds that were reported by the state's casinos in 2016.

So why are Minnesota's gambling loss deduction laws so restrictive? The answer lies with the state's Tax Fairnessandraise Initiative (TFI), which was passed by voters in 2012. The TFI prohibits any deductions for gambling losses that exceed the amount of gambling winnings reported on your tax return.

While this may seem like a fair policy, it can actually be quite punitive for people who suffer from problem gambling behavior. Problem gamblers often end up losing much more money than they win, and are thus unable to deduct their losses from their taxable income. This can lead to some very large tax bills, which can further exacerbate the problem gambler's financial woes.

Fortunately, there is hope on the horizon for problem gamblers in Minnesota. A new bill proposed by State Senator Chris Eaton would raise the deduction limit for gambling losses from $10,000 to $30,000. This would allow problem gamblers to get more relief from their taxes, and could help to reduce some of the financial stress associated with problem gambling behavior.
