#  What is the objective of the game? 
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are awarded for hitting targets and for hitting targets in a specific order. The game is won when all of the targets have been hit in the correct order. 

# What are the targets? 
The targets are discs that are set up in a specific pattern. There are six different target patterns, and each one awards a different number of points. In addition, some patterns award bonus points for hitting them in a specific order. 

# How do I hit the target? 
To hit the target, you must launch your disc at it and make contact. The angle and power of your throw will affect how close to the center of the target your disc lands. If you hit the target squarely, you will earn full points for that hit. If you miss the target entirely, you will not score any points for that throw. 

# What are the rules? 
There are a few basic rules that you need to know in order to play: 
-You can only throw one disc at a time
-You can only throw from behind the starting line
-You cannot cross the finish line until your disc has come to a stop

#  What are the different symbols in the game and what do they represent?

The Eye of Horus is a powerful symbol that represents protection, healing, and good luck. It is often used to ward off evil spirits. In the game, it can be used to heal allies or damage enemies.

# How do I know how much I can win?

The payout for each bet is displayed next to the bet amount. The payout changes depending on how likely or unlikely the event is to happen.

# What are the different types of bets I can make?

There are three types of bets: Single, Double, and Treble. A Single bet is when you pick one outcome and bet on it. A Double is when you pick two outcomes and bet on them both happening. A Treble is when you pick three outcomes and bet on them all happening.

#  What are the different bonus features in the game?

The bonus round is another popular bonus that offers rewards to the player. This bonus round is typically activated when the player completes a specific task, such as landing on a certain symbol on the reels. Once the bonus round has been activated, the player can then play a mini-game for a chance to win additional prizes.
