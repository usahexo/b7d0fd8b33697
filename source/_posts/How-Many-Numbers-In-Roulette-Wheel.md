#  How Many Numbers Are In A Roulette Wheel?

When you’re playing roulette, whether it’s in a casino or online, you probably have a few questions about the game. How do the odds work? What are the winning numbers? How many numbers are in a roulette wheel, anyhow? 

In European roulette - which is the most popular kind - there are 37 numbers on the wheel, from 0 to 36. The red and black numbers are alternated around the wheel, with 18 on each side. 

There are two green pockets on the wheel: 0 and 00. These are called “the house pockets”, because they’re where the casino makes its money. If you bet on any of these numbers, your odds of winning are pretty slim; in fact, they’re just 2.7%. 

The other 35 numbers on the wheel have different odds, depending on where you bet. The highest payout is for hitting a number that’s been bet on by numerous players - these pay out at 36-1. But if you hit one of these numbers, you’ll only get your original stake back plus the amount that each player has bet on that number. So if someone has bet $10 on a particular number and you hit it, you’d win $370 ($10 stake + $360 winnings). 

Most people don’t bet on single numbers; instead, they spread their money out over several different bets. This way, their chances of winning increase - without having to risk as much money per bet.

The number sequence is not random and was purposely designed that way to make it more difficult for players to win. The numbers increase in value going clockwise around the wheel starting with the 0 (zero) and ending with the 36.

Now that you know how many numbers are in a roulette game, it’s time to learn about some of the other important aspects of this classic casino game!

#  What's The Number On A Roulette Wheel?

When you gamble, what's the number on a roulette wheel? The number that is spinning around and may soon be landing on your chosen number is called the “winning number.”

The winning number is determined by the roulette wheel, which has 37 slots numbered 0-36. A little ball falls into one of these slots once the wheel has stopped spinning.

Bets can be placed on a particular number or a range of numbers. There are also bets available for black or red, even or odd, and low (1-18) or high (19-36) numbers. You can also betting on whether the winning number will be within any of these ranges.

So, how do casinos make money? Casinos make money because the odds of winning are in their favour. The house edge is the percentage of each wager that the casino expects to keep over time. For American roulette, this house edge is 5.26%. This means that for every $100 you bet, the casino expects to keep $5.26 over time.
