#  Japan legalizes gambling!

On July 1, 2019, Japan officially legalized gambling. This is a momentous event for the country, as it has been working on this legislation for years. The new law allows casinos to be built in major cities, such as Tokyo and Osaka.

This decision is sure to have a significant impact on the Japanese economy. Gambling is expected to generate $40 billion in revenue each year, which will help to boost the country’s struggling tourism industry. In addition, the new law is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs.

There has been some opposition to the legalization of gambling in Japan. Some people are concerned about the potential for addiction and crime. However, proponents argue that these dangers can be managed through regulation.

Casinos are set to open in Japan in 2020. In the meantime, there is much speculation about who will win the race to build the first one.

#  Gambling in Japan: when did it become legal and what are the restrictions?

Gambling in Japan is a legal grey area. Although it is not specifically illegal, there are restrictions on the type of gambling that is legal.

The first Japanese casino opened in 2016, and there are now over 20 casinos in operation across the country. The majority of these casinos are in integrated resorts, which also include hotels, restaurants and other forms of entertainment.

Only three types of gambling are currently legal in Japan: pachinko, horse racing and lotteries. All other types of gambling are technically illegal, but prosecutions are rare. In fact, the government has been increasingly liberalising gambling laws in recent years.

So why is gambling a legal grey area in Japan? The reason is because it is regulated by the police rather than the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), as is the case with other forms of entertainment such as movies and video games. This gives the police a lot of discretion when it comes to enforcement.

There are a number of restrictions on gambling in Japan. First, only citizens and permanent residents can gamble at licensed venues. Second, bets cannot exceed 10,000 yen (around $90). Third, casinos can only operate for a maximum of 18 hours per day. Fourth, casinos must be located more than 500 metres from schools, hospitals and churches. Fifth, people under the age of 20 are not allowed inside casinos. Sixth, employees at casinos must be over 20 years old. Seventh, casino operators must pay a 30% tax on gross gaming revenue.

The restrictions on gambling are primarily aimed at preventing problem gambling. Statistics show that around 2% of the population suffers from problem gambling, although this figure is likely to be an underestimate as many people do not admit to having a problem. The government has been reluctant to liberalise gambling laws further given the potential for increased problem gambling rates.

Nevertheless, the government has been gradually liberalising gambling laws in recent years in an attempt to boost tourism and stimulate the economy. In 2018, a bill was introduced which would have allowed Japanese citizens to gamble online from overseas sites, but this bill did not pass into law.

#  Japan's new gambling law: what you need to know

Since December 2017, casinos have been legal in Japan. But there are a few things that you need to know about the new gambling law before you go and spend your hard-earned yen at the nearest casino.

First of all, there are only three types of gambling that are currently legal in Japan: pachinko, horse racing, and lotteries. So if you're looking to try your hand at blackjack or roulette, you're out of luck for now.

Japan's new gambling law is also quite restrictive when it comes to who can actually gamble. Only people who are 20 years or older are allowed to gamble in a casino, and Japanese citizens are not allowed to gamble in casinos overseas.

And finally, while casinos may be legal in Japan, they're not exactly easy to come by. There are currently only three casinos in the country, and they're all located on resort islands (such as Okinawa and Hokkaido). So if you're not keen on travelling too far, you may be out of luck.

#  What are the benefits of legalizing gambling in Japan?

Gambling is considered a vice by many people, but the fact is that it can also provide a number of benefits to society. This has been recognized in Japan, where gambling is legal in certain forms. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits of legalizing gambling in Japan.

1) Increased tax revenue. Gambling can generate a lot of tax revenue for the government, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as funding social welfare programs or building infrastructure.

2) Job creation. The legalized gambling industry can create jobs for people in a wide range of fields, from casino workers to software developers. This can help boost the economy and reduce unemployment.

3) Entertainment and tourism. Legalized gambling can attract tourists to a country, providing an economic boost to local businesses. It can also be entertaining for locals, providing them with an enjoyable form of recreation.

4) Economic stimulus. Gambling can stimulate the economy by encouraging people to spend money on gaming terminals, lottery tickets, and other forms of gambling. This can help spur economic growth and create new jobs.

There are many benefits to legalizing gambling in Japan and it is clear that the country has made the right decision in this regard.

#  How will Japan's new gambling law affect the gaming industry?

On July 14, 2017, the Japanese Diet (parliament) passed a bill legalizing gambling in Japan. This new law is expected to have a major impact on the gaming industry in Japan.

The new law will allow casinos to be built in Japan, and it will also legalize gambling on horse racing, boat races, and other sporting events. In addition, the law will create a new regulatory body called the Japan Gaming Commission that will be responsible for regulating the gaming industry in Japan.

The passage of this bill is seen as a major victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has been pushing for its passage since 2016. Abe has said that the new law will help boost the economy and create jobs in Japan.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased crime and social ills. They also argue that it is not clear how the revenue from gambling will be used.

Casinos are expected to open in 2020, and operators are already jockeying for position. Major casino operators such as MGM Resorts International and Las Vegas Sands Corporation are expected to be among the leading contenders to win licenses to operate casinos in Japan.
